# About

Hey there, I'm Gabriell.

I'm an engineer, fueled by coffee and cheese. I build things, I fix things and
I break things. And I like simplicity.

I currently live in Berlin and do systems engineering at
[Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/).

The main purpose of this blog is to practice my writing and to learn more about
the topics I want to write about. I have an [introductory
post](../../posts/2023/07/hello-world/) where I give my reasons for keeping
this blog.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/gabriellhrn) or
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@gabriell). I also have
[email](mailto:gabriellhrn@gmail.com).
