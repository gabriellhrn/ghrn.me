I had a teacher tell me once, back when I was in technical school, that my first
program, when learning a new programming language, should always be a
"Hello, World!". She told me that otherwise I would be cursed and would never
learn the new language.

I don't consider myself a superstitious person, but almost 15 years have passed and
I continue following her caution â€” although, as you may have noticed, the exclamation
mark is no longer there; I find its enthusiasm a little too much now. But the
"Hello World" still remains, even as the first entry in a blog. How else could
I start?

Writing a blog is something I've thought about for some time, but never really
got around to doing. I put up so many blockers for this and they just kept me
from doing what I wanted to do: write. Things like "I need a good domain",
"I don't write well enough" or "My blog needs a cool design". For these,
I'm forcing myself to think that they aren't blockers. Anything I do for the first
time is not going to be the best version of itself, so I might as well improve it as I go.

But I also kept thinking things like "What would I write about?" or "Why does anyone need
yet another blog?". The internet already has plenty of content for whatever you
want to read about. A new blog is just another drop in the ocean. It's meaningless
and I'm honestly not even sure if anyone will ever read it. Still I'm
going to write for my own sake. Here's what I think: writing will
help me go deeper into topics I want to learn more about because I can
organize my ideas better when I write and I research what I want to write
about; I write a lot at work and getting better at it can help me be more
efficient and writing also improves my communication skills; I want to remember
what I did in the past and see how much I've grown.

So I think I'm good. I have where to write and where to publish. And I have my
reason for writing. Now I have to make a habit of it and, let's hope, in the future
I can go back to this post and all the many others I've written and find a
little joy in it, in seeing how little I knew and in enjoying some nostalgia.
